## 1st Project For Avalanche

 ## I have used one public function to implement all three function to show errors.

## Description

Solidity uses state-reverting exceptions to handle errors. 
Such an exception undoes all changes made to the state in the current call and all its sub-calls and reports the error to the caller. 
Errors can occur at compile time or runtime. Methods used for error handling in solidity are require, assert, revert.

## Let's Started

* The simplest way to compile and deploy a solidity contract is using online remix IDE.

### Executing program

* Go to the online remix IDE
* Create a new file and add the project(first.sol)
* Now, compile and deploy the contract
* Apply all values according to given condition
